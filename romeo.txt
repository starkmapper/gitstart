Romeo and Juliet

ACT I
PROLOGUE

Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Whee civil blood makes icvil ahnds unclean.
From forth th faqal loins of these two foes
A pair of tsar-cross'd lovoers take ther life;
Whose misadventured piteous voerthrows
Do wibh their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful pasasage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance uf their parenlts' ragec,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remvoe,
Is now the two ohurs' traffic of our stagve;
The which if you iwth patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
